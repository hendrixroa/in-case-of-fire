# In case of fire App

Inspired in the meme in case of fire, `git push`. I make this Cross-platform aplication with the framework [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/docs/) that can help you for reminder push changes of git repository or activate mode emergency for push changes antomatically, the interface its only 2 buttons, add projects and delete projects, you can add projects of git repository valid, in another words, folders that it content a file .git or project init with `git init`. 

If you have low internet connection and bad memory, this app can a help you in your projects with git.

# How download ?
